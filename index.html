  					<h1>Kana</h1>
  					<center>
  					<h2 id="h2">The kana refer to the two syllabaries used in Japanese, referred to collectively as the kana. The kana are derived from something called ‘Manyogana’, which are kanji (see below) that were used to write sounds.
  					<br><br>
            Hiragana (ひらがな) is the syllabary used most commonly in Japanese. Hiragana are an (extremely) cursive form of the Manyogana. A character for the sound ‘ya’ in Manyogana, for example, is 也. The character for ‘ya’ in Hiragana is や, and is derived from 也.<br>
            The Hiragana actually came about later than the katakana. The Hiragana are said to be created by a group of noble women, and the Hiragana are generally used to write Japanese phonetically. 
            <br><br>
            Katakana (カタカナ) literally means “fragment kana”, and was formed by taking different parts of various kanji and using those elements to represent sound. For example, the katakana character for ‘ka’ is カ, and this usage is derived from the left-side of the kanji 加 whose reading is also ‘ka’. Katakana is used for the names of animals, certain onomatopoeia words, certain ‘new’ words like ‘karaoke’, certain slang words and new words introduced into the language from other foreign languages. Katakana is somewhat like upper-case letters for its specialized usage.
            <br><br>
            You will need to learn Hiragana before you attempt any other part of the language. <br>
            Katakana is also a base requirement, but you shouldn’t keep yourself from starting with the parts discussed in the next section once you know Hiragana.<br>
            You can learn Katakana while learning basic grammar. It is not recommended to start learning Kanji before you have a good grasp on both Hiragana and Katakana.</h2>

  					<h1>Kanji</h1>
  					<center>
  						<h2 id="h2">
  								Kanji are characters which originated from China and represent both ideas and pronunciations, though some domestic kanji, referred to as ‘Kokuji’ (国字 - “Country character”) exist. For a general outline of kanji, you might refer to this. For more in-depth information on the different types of kanji and so forth, you might refer to this. For information on the stroke order of kanji, you could use kakijun.jp, the Heisig books (kanji sub-section below), or the Kanji Stroke Order Font (Misc. sub-section), etc. You don’t have to learn stroke order, but understanding the stroke order of Kanji and Kanji radicals (The “building blocks” of Kanji) lends to being able to identify Kanji in handwritten scribbles and different fonts.
                  <br><br>
                  Studying Kanji can be undergone in a number of different ways using varying methods. If you would like to explore some methods, please refer to the ‘Kanji’ sub-section in the ‘Resource’ section below. After you have an idea of which you would like to use, please go to ankiweb.net and download the deck to Anki. (Ctrl+f ‘Anki’ for some information)<br>
                  Not all people choose to study kanji individually. Some people believe or find that individual study of the kanji is not as practical as simply learning the kanji via vocabulary (next section below).

  					<h1>Vocabulary</h1>
  					<center>
  						<h2 id="h2">
							With Anki you can download a pre-made deck (recommended) with pronunciation as well as listening comprehension for vocabulary. The core decks are considered the standard for acquiring base vocab, but due to lots of Anki decks being nuked from the shared deck service recently,  you should refer to the cornucopia of resources for the core decks.<br>
							Another technique to explore is sentence mining, which is the process of gathering sentences and inserting them into Anki (or anything else) and reviewing them. This is a good way to provide meaningful context to the words you wish to study, as well as a way to remember how to express certain ideas. Writing is most helpful for recalling and reproducing information, but writing can take a notable amount of time.

  					<h1>Grammar</h1>
  					<center>
  						<h2 id="h2">
  							Grammar will allow you to both form and understand sentences in Japanese. There are three guides and sources that we recommend: Genki, Tae Kim and Japanese: the Manga Way. The pros and cons of each are listed in the ‘Grammar’ Section. If you are unsure of which one you should choose, we recommend that you try them all and see which of them is most suitable for you.<br>
                When you want to refer to something for grammar,  the 「Dictionaries of Japanese Grammar」 are fantastic and they can be found in the pastebin (Ctrl+F “DOJG”). There is also a simplified online version <a href="http://jiten.clanteam.com/">here</a>, which takes the example sentences from the book and sorts them by each grammar point for quick lookup (there may be some typos in the online version due to OCR).

              Listening will be an essential skill if you want to watch anime without subtitles, j-drama, other japanese tv productions or listen to radio shows.
              <br><br>
              Production skills are what you will need if you want not only to listen to Japanese people speaking, but to speak to them as well, or to exchange written communications. <br>
              Listening and production are not essential for understanding Japanese, unlike with Parts 2a-c.</h2>

              After learning (at least) basic Japanese grammar, you can, and should, start reading and learning words from actual Japanese. You can find recommended reading, including games, in the ‘Learning Resources’ section, along with some websites to assist you with listening and writing.
              <br><br>
              When reading while aided by tools (as all beginners should be), it’s best for the purposes of learning to look at the words you’re looking up, and try to make an educated guess as to what the meaning is before completing your lookup, as guessing the answer helps with committing it to memory. It’s also a good idea to jump into the deep end of the difficulty pool from time to time. This is especially true at the very beginning even when you know it’s impossible, and that you’ll understand next to nothing and in general have a bad time of it, because it helps to have a better idea of where you are/were at in the larger scheme of consuming Japanese media, and where your current learning method is getting you. If you have no exposure to things which are difficult, then you will be unable to overcome them when you do meet them. If you only make use of beginner-level media, then you will only have proficiency in the language at that level. Similarly, in order to reach fluency in Japanese, the sources of media which you consume must also be varied in difficulty and content.
